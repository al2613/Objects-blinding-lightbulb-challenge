# Objects-blinding-lightbulb-challenge

JavaScript Objects Lightbulb-challenge

Goal: This challenge is meant to help soldify the concept of objects in Javascript by working with specific object properties, specifically accessing requested properties and manipulating arrays in the context of JavaScript objects.

Task:

We need to assign each of the ranger-devs to a super-blinding light bulb based on their station number. Our ultimate goal
is to build a function that creates an alert message for the ranger-devs in the following format:

Avast, me hearties!
There be Pirates nearby! Stations!
Nick Walsh, man the Solar Death Ray!
Drew Barontini, man the Supernova!
Christine Wong, man the Firestorm!

Running the Tests:

You can copy and paste the starter code into JavaScript section of https://jsfiddle.net/

Hints:
1. Create a for loop to loop through all of the rangers at the location, using the numRangers property to keep track.
2. Inside the loop, use the correct property to append the name of the current ranger to the list
3. Concactenate the text between the ranger name and superblinder so it matches the requested format 
4. Add the name of the correct super-blinding light bulb from the weaponBulbs array to the list. In order to retrieve the name of the correct bulb, you’ll need to use the ranger’s station number.
