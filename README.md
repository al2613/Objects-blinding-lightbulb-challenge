# Objects-blinding-lightbulb-challenge

JavaScript Objects Lightbulb-challenge

Goal: This challenge is meant to help soldify the concept of objects in Javascript by working with specific object properties 
and understanding how function expressions can be manipulated into methods

Task:

We need to assign each of the ranger-devs to a super-blinding light bulb based on their station number. Our ultimate goal
is to build a function that creates an alert message for the ranger-devs in the following format:

Avast, me hearties!
There be Pirates nearby! Stations!
Nick Walsh, man the Solar Death Ray!
Drew Barontini, man the Supernova!
Christine Wong, man the Firestorm!
